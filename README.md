## Project Idea

AskMe is a platform that allows users to post questions and receive answers from others in the same city. For users in a hurry, a subscription model is available, allowing them to pay a fee for quicker responses. The application includes features for selecting a city, categorizing questions, adding images, and two options for posting questions: instant post or subscription-based post.

## Application Description

If you have a question or inquiry, you can enter the AskMe application, write your question, and people from the same city will respond based on their experiences. If you need a quick response, you can pay a certain amount, for example, $10, for a 5-hour priority subscription for your question. Users can post questions by choosing the city and category, typing the question, and uploading images if needed. There are two options: choosing to subscribe for instant question prioritization or posting a regular question.
